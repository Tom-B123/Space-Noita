Overall plan for game structure.

Centred around respawning.
Oil is needed to fire weapons, power machines and buy new things.
Each death costs some oil to recover, including allied deaths.

Game loop = collect more and more oil on larger and larger scales until forced to run out.

Oil can be lost by reviving units, or can be stolen.

Temporary items and permanent gear can be bought with oil.
