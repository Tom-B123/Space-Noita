Projectiles from weapons

- Ship - scale weapons will hit anything for massive damage.
- Person scale weapons will avoid friendly fire, aside from negative status effects like fire
- Projectiles are their own entities and will interact differently with different materials on contact
- Bullets ricochet off slanted metal, energy weapons melt metal, explosives turn metal into shrapnel.
